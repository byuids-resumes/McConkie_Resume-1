# Resume Feedback: July 2021
__by Jacob Farr__

# Positives
- super cool that you worked as a CFO
- great evidence of marketing experience
- tells your story very well
- your links actually go places

# Improvements
- Unclear what makes you a data scientist (but I'm no expert, so I don't really know what to look for in a data scientist)
- Lacks a skills (tools and technologies) section to summarize your qualifications

**No real complaints... this is a pretty good resume! Have you heard of [VMock](https://www.vmock.com/byui)? The school provides it for free to all students. You you can try sending your resume through their algorithms to get more feedback.**
